# Student Companion Application


### _Prototype application made for project of Future Ready Talent Internship_

#### Industry: Ed-Tech

#### Project Title: Student Companion Application

#### Problem Statement/Opportunity:
Since the rise of online classes and blended / hybrid methods of teaching, students have been finding it difficult to share notes and keep track of test / assignment submission dates along with sharing general information on their college happenings such as hackathons, events and so on. Students need a centralized solution to keep up with the announcements from college as well, instead of just depending on their official website that will take time to update in case of any notification. They also need an official channel straight from the college officials and offices, without being fooled by the rise of fake circulars being shared. This project aims to be a centralized solution to students, having an official channel without depending on the college system for timely updates.. The app also allows to set deadlines and reminders for their classes

#### Project Description :
This project aims to create a streamlined method of communication between students, their department officials and the main college office itself. It has separated login systems for each user type, allowing restricted access to posting information. This allows higher authorities to post and share official authorized documents and circulars. The same applies to department offices and their approved notices. The students can login into a section / classroom entity created by the department and have their homework / assignment news shared there. This allows all students to keep track of what is happening in their classroom. Even though transfer of information has become more fluent, there is an absence of a means of filtering the useful and important information from the huge amount of information. Instead of depending on whatsapp message groups which tend to get overloaded with unecessary information leading out to important messages being missed out. This is especially a major problem for students where each student is involved in multiple groups with a huge overflow of useful and non relevant information. This project aims to solve this problem of filtering. The main objective of the project is to provide a bank of information such as tasks to be performed by an individual, keep track of relevant information regarding the college, specialized section for notes, and group related content. recently, due to the pandemic, the shift from in campus to online classes have seriously affected the flow of information in institutions. Multiple groups created, leads to confusion and loss of important details regarding notes, institutional announcements, etc.
